## Quick and easy updates to improve your Star Citizen Experience

At the time of this writing it is impossible to adjust the CPU priority via
Task Manager. If you attempt to adjust the Priority or Affinity you'll be
greeted with an "Access Denied" error. To circumvent this issue we use a
registry update to tell windows how to handle `StarCitizen.exe`.

### Apply the registry update

1. Download the file [StarCitizen_HighPriority.reg](StarCitizen_HighPriority.reg).
2. Double click the file to open it.
3. READ the disclaimer, click "yes" to continue.
4. Enjoy better performing Star Citizen.
